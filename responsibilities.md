# Roles and Responsibilities for curriculum development

There are a variety of opportunities to participate in curriculum development of training and community materials.

## Core team

Staff employed by Fred Hutch as a part of the team for data and computational training and community are responsible for:
- ongoing maintenance of existing (published) materials
- coordinating with experts at Fred Hutch to develop and guide new curriculum development
- mentoring interns, volunteers, and TAs who are developing materials for training and community 

## MCB Alternative TA-ships

We participate in the alternative TA-ships offerred by UW's MCB program by sponsoring 1-3 graduate students each summer.
These TAs agree to ~90 hours of commitment throughout the summer,
and support teaching and curriculum development for data and computational methods for the biomedical research community.

The main objectives of this teaching assistantship include:
- Observe and assist in teaching introductory computational classes taught by current instructors 
- Learn general methods for teaching computational methods
- Develop training materials (new lessons, practice exercises, or example coding projects)

Previous materials developed as a part of this program include:
- [scRNAseq](https://github.com/fredhutchio/scRNAseq): single cell RNAseq data analysis using monocle and garnett
