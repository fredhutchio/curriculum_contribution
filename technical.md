# Technical and logistical considerations for developing training materials

## Choosing suggested IDEs and interfaces

FIXME: balancing ease of transmitting information

## Rendering of materials for a general audience

FIXME: gh-pages rendering

GitHub repositories contain course materials

The link to learner-facing, rendered materials are available on the right-hand side of the GitHub repository page under **About**.
For an example, see [this repository](https://github.com/fredhutchio/curriculum_contribution).

## Reusing other materials

- Carpentries or other orgs with cohesive content
- tutorials and vignettes from software packages
- images

Consider if these materials have licenses that allow the content to be reused,
and under what conditions.
