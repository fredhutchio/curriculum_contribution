# Contributing to fredhutch.io curriculum development

This repository includes information on contributing to training materials developed and maintained by [fredhutch.io](http://fredhutch.io) and [the Coop](http://thecoop.fredhutch.org).
Training materials include both formally-structured [short courses](#courses)
and [practice projects](#practice-projects).
Please see the subheading of each to understand how these different types of materials are developed.

For information on preparing for and teaching fredhutch.io lessons,
please see our [repository of instructor notes](https://fredhutchio.github.io/instructors).

## Courses

Courses represent an overview of a specific topic,
and possess the following characteristics:
- non-linear in narrative, and explore data or techniques along with common "gotchas" and "ifs"
- integrate across potential use cases and list options relevant to multiple analyses
- includes challenge exercises
- although code can be exported, it does not translate specifically to production-level scripts (includes interactive and exploratory code)

The links below are for the GitHub repositories containing course materials.
The link to learner-facing, rendered materials are available on the right-hand side of the repository under **About**.

## Practice projects

Practice projects provide challenge exercises,
code examples,
and prompts to create complete projects,
which support learners at various levels of expertise.

Practice projects possess the following characteristics:
- includes challenge exercises
- code equivalent of a manuscript ready for submission
- linear in narrative
- focus on a single analysis and justify the best options for a particular analysis

### Practice projects in development

- [COVID19](https://github.com/fredhutchio/practice-covid)
- [Machine Learning](https://github.com/fredhutchio/python_data_viz)
