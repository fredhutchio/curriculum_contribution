# Contributing to fredhutch.io curriculum development

This repository includes information on contributing to training materials developed and maintained by [fredhutch.io](http://fredhutch.io) and [the Coop](http://thecoop.fredhutch.org).

For information on preparing for and teaching fredhutch.io lessons,
please see our [repository of instructor notes](https://github.com/fredhutchio/instructors).

## Differences between training materials

- courses
  - non-linear in narrative, and explore data or techniques along with common "gotchas" and "ifs"
  - integrate across potential use cases and list options relevant to multiple analyses
  - includes challenge exercises
  - although code can be exported, it does not translate specifically to production-level scripts (includes interactive and exploratory code)

- practice projects
  - includes challenge exercises
  - example projects 
    - code equivalent of a manuscript ready for submission
    - linear in narrative
    - focus on a single analysis and justify the best options for a particular analysis
- SciWiki documentation
