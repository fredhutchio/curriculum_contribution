This repository includes information on contributing to training materials developed and maintained by [fredhutch.io](http://fredhutch.io) and [the Coop](http://thecoop.fredhutch.org):

  - [Active courses](#active-courses)
  - [Courses in development](#courses-in-development)
  - [Practice projects](#practice-projects)

The following pages include specific information about how and why our materials are created and maintained:

- [Coursework](coursework): formally-structured short courses that provide a general overview of an area (requirements and how to develop)
- [Practice projects](practice_projects): demonstrate how data and coding concepts integrate in a project (requirements and how to develop)
- [Technical and logistical considerations for developing materials](technical)
- [Additional resources and supplemental reading](resources)
- [Roles and responsibilities for curriculum development](responsibilities)
